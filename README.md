Stuffs on traveling and living on this planet.
Traveling and living are the major activity of my life. I have been and will be visiting many places on this planet and even trying to live in different places for two weeks, one year or even more.
I believe in us as human-beings, are naturally capable of putting themselves in any place as long as it is part of our planet. 
We are capable to accept ourselves no matter which identity we are placed in, as long as we learn to call this whole world home.
Sometimes it's not only love and generosity that is changing the world, but also the acceptance of who we are, and the effort one has paid in recognition of each other as his/her family members. 
The family is a wide concept, it is international, intercultural or even interspecific.
